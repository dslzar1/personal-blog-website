<h1>- Blog Post #1 -</h1>
<p> When I first started working on my website, I didn't like how anything appeared and thought it was visually dull, so I modified the layout and as it slowly started to come together, I was pleased with the eventual result. I didn't notice any errors at first because my website appeared to be fine until I checked my HTML and discovered that I had forgotten a whole closing body tag. In the future, I'd like my website to have an animated background so that there's something moving in the background on my homepage, which would be pretty cool. <br><br>
One aspect of HTML that I liked was that once you understand the basic structure of an HTML webpage, adding the rest is simple. However, the spacing of the div tags confused me; I had no idea how to organize or where to put them. One aspect of CSS that I liked was the ability to layout my website as I wanted. For example, I used "text-align: center" and "margin-top: 18px" when I wanted my header to be in the middle but not too close to the top. CSS was difficult for me at first because I didn't know where to start or what to put in it.</p>
